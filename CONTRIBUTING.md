# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

A few rules of thumb:
- Code contributions should match the existing code style. `npm run lint:js` and `npm run lint:ts` could help you check
- Discuss additions/changes with us [on Discord](https://abal.moe/Eris/invite) before working on them
- Check the dev branch to make sure someone hasn't worked on the same thing already
- Pull requests should point to the dev branch, not master
